# This is my Emacs setup

Currently for most of the init.el file I'm using the emacs-kicker by dimitri. You can find that here: https://github.com/dimitri/emacs-kicker

So far, that's it, but I'm sure there will be a lot more configuration to come. Aside from a few custom things to set modes and stuff, that's about it.
